            "content_html": "<p><strong>Wednesday, 9 March 2022</strong></p>\n<p><em>Secondary school duo amaze judges, take top spot for exemplary engineering and qualify for the world's most prestigious robotics championship event in Dallas, Texas</em></p>\n<p>On Saturday, 5 March, a team of two year 11 students known as <em>The Lads </em>fought against 24 of the UK's top teams at Haberdashers' Boys' School. Seb Jensen and Damian Rusecki brought the <em>Design Award </em>back to St Helena School, Colchester for comprehensive robot construction, programming, and strategy documentation. With it, they have qualified for the VEX Robotics World Championship presented by Northrop Grumman Foundation in Dallas, Texas, from 5-7 May 2022.</p>\n<p>The VEX Robotics Competition is a global programme targeting secondary schools and collegiate groups. It promotes the vast STEM (science, technology, engineering, and maths) fields and engages students with a new competitive challenge every season. Each participating country sends a select few of their premier teams to compete at the world's largest annual celebration of robotics and STEM - and this year, <em>The Lads </em>made the cut.</p>\n<p>The <em>Design Award </em>is presented to the team who have best presented the development of their robot throughout the season. Seb and Damian were interviewed by a panel of six judges, and demonstrated effective communication skills, teamwork, and professionalism, impressing all and receiving the esteemed award at Haberdashers' Boys' School.</p>\n<p>To represent Colchester, Essex, and the UK, Seb and Damian have now taken it upon themselves to start raising the funds needed to compete in America. They would be the first team from St Helena School, Colchester, to represent the United Kingdom at the VEX Robotics World Championship.</p>\n<p>The expenses will include the registration fee, flights, and accomodation. The team is looking for £4,000 from the community to cover this.
